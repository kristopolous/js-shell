# JS-Shell
Just a debugging shell ... go here for a demo: http://9ol.es/js-shell/shell.html

# Usage

    _Shell.init(dom container);

Once in you have 

 * history with up/down, ctrl+p/n
 * searchable object (something like search document append will show you)
 * tab completion 
   * broken down by object type, 
   * alphabetically, 
   * observing object hierarchy when possible
 * function injection
 * clickable stack-traces
 * clickable auto-complete

Tired of firebug and chrome inspector giving you no auto-complete when people do OOP in Javascript way way wrong (I'm looking at you, yfiles for html, you total piece of absolute shit) ... well this will fix that stupidity.

Have fun and move away from those crap libraries as quick as possible.
